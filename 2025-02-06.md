1. **Looked at Deepseek Janus , tried to install it.** 
deepseek pro 7 is available at the following page: https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/Janus-Pro-7B

It is supposed to be an any-to-any model. Could produce in theory from any modality to any modality. I think that it will not be a great model for video question answering (sounds too good be true for any-to-any models) but one needs to see. 

I pulled the git repo, I wrote a small code to use this model, and push a small gradio app so people can check it. However after a couple of iterations the issue came out to be of flash attention. Only new nvidia gpus a100, and h100 are Ampere architectures, which are expensive and difficult to get from cloud VMs because of longer queues. I tried for about an hour installing flash attention but could not do it. couple of VM starts, etc..
