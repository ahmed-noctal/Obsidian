### Summary

Ahmed Jawad and Shahzad Hameed investigated unexpectedly high GCP billing costs, specifically a $600 charge on February 6th, caused by high data transfers and VM/storage location across multiple regions.  They recommended consolidating resources to the US Central Iowa region, optimizing VM usage (including deleting unnecessary VMs and implementing run-time reduction schedules), and discussing data transfer needs with Iftekhar to reduce costs to approximately $2000 monthly.  Regular cost monitoring and investigation into unclear GCP billing reporting are crucial next steps.

### Details

- High GCP Costs and Troubleshooting Ahmed Jawad and Shahzad Hameed analyzed unusually high Google Cloud Platform (GCP) billing costs, specifically a $600 charge on February 6th. They investigated data transfer costs, noting unusually high transfers from Europe to the Americas. They suspected data issues in the billing report and attempted to rectify them by reimporting the data.  Ahmed Jawad concluded that the high costs were due to the location of their VMs and storage buckets across multiple regions, and that consolidating resources to the US Central Iowa region would significantly reduce expenses.
    
- VM and Storage Optimization  Ahmed Jawad proposed several solutions to reduce costs. They recommended consolidating all services to the US Central Iowa region, replacing a large, expensive disk in Europe West with a smaller, more cost-effective solution in the US Central region. They also suggested using smaller, more temporary VMs as needed, rather than consistently running large, expensive ones. Specific actions include deleting unnecessary VMs and disks,  and implementing a schedule to reduce VM run time. They also recommended discussing data transfer needs with Iftekhar to minimize unnecessary data transfers.
    
- Cost Reduction Strategy and Future Monitoring  Ahmed Jawad suggested that by consolidating resources and optimizing VM usage, they could reduce monthly costs to roughly $2000.  They emphasized the importance of regularly monitoring daily costs and investigating the root causes of high expenses, including addressing unclear reporting from the GCP billing system. They identified several recurring high-cost factors, such as SSD capacity and inter-region data transfers, and discussed potential cost-saving measures, including scheduling VMs and using Google Cloud Storage as a disk alternative.
