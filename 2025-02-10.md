**Dataset:** Social IQ Dataset  
**Hours Spent:** 5.7

### **Activities Conducted**

**Tutorial Followed:**

- Location: `Llava-finetuning` folder
    
- File: `Fine_tune_LLaVa_NeXT_Video_with_HFTrainer.ipynb`
    

**Files Updated:**

- Location: `Llava-finetuning` folder
    
- File: `Llava_social_iq.ipynb`
    

### **Progress Report**

Following the tutorial, the dataset preparation for fine-tuning was successfully executed. The following features were extracted and structured accordingly:

- `video_id`
    
- `video_path`
    
- `instruction`
    
- `transcript`
    
- `questions`
    
- `correct_answers`
    
- `incorrect_answers`
    

Additionally, the transcript, questions, correct answers, and incorrect answers were successfully separated. The instruction format was also modified to align with the fine-tuning requirements.

### **Next Steps**

- Prepare and load the custom dataset in the `LLaVa-Next-Video` format, ensuring it is ready for the fine-tuning process.
